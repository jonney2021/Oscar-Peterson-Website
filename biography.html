            <br><br>
            <h3> Youth </h2>
            <p> Peterson was born in Montreal, Quebec, to immigrants from the West Indies (Saint Kitts and Nevis and the
                British Virgin Islands); His mother, Kathleen, was a domestic worker and his father, Daniel, worked
                as a porter for Canadian Pacific Railway and was an amateur musician who taught himself to play the
                organ, trumpet and piano.<br><br>
                Peterson grew up in the neighbourhood of Little Burgundy in Montreal.
                It was in this predominantly black neighbourhood that he encountered the jazz culture. At the age of
                five, Peterson began honing his skills on trumpet and piano, but a bout of tuberculosis when he was
                seven prevented him from playing the trumpet again, so he directed all his attention to the piano. His
                father was one of his first music teachers, and his sister Daisy taught him classical piano. Peterson
                was persistent at practising scales and classical études.</p> <br><br>
            <h3> Career </h3>
            <p>In 1949 Peterson went to the United States, where he appeared in one of jazz promoter Norman Granz’s
                concerts at Carnegie Hall, New York City. He was associated with Granz for most of the rest of his
                career, touring the world with Granz’s all-star Jazz at the Philharmonic troupe and recording
                prolifically for Granz’s record labels.<br><br>
                Art Tatum and especially Nat King Cole were important influences
                on Peterson’s style. Like Cole’s early trio, the Oscar Peterson Trio that first became popular featured
                piano, bass (Ray Brown), and guitar, most notably Herb Ellis (1953–58). When Ellis left the group, he
                was replaced by drummer Ed Thigpen (1959–65).</p><br><br>

            <p>Cascades of many notes characterized Peterson’s playing. His earlier work, if often glib, was
                nevertheless invariably swinging. In the 1970s he began playing frequent solo concerts and duets, often
                with bassist Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen. These proved the most rewarding medium for his talents, and
                he became one of the most popular jazz pianists of his time.<br><br>
                His 1974–75 duet albums with trumpeters
                Dizzy Gillespie, Roy Eldridge, Harry Edison, Clark Terry, and Jon Faddis demonstrated generous warmth
                and sensitivity. His recordings won eight Grammy Awards. In 1999 he received the Japan Art Association’s
                Praemium Imperiale prize for music.<br><br>

            <h3> Later years </h3>

                Peterson continued to perform until 2006, although his public appearances became sporadic after a stroke
                in 1993 affected the use of his left hand as well as his ability to walk. He was the author of Jazz
                Exercises and Pieces (1965) and Oscar Peterson New Piano Solos (1965). His autobiography, A Jazz
                Odyssey: The Life of Oscar Peterson, was published in 2002.</p><br>
