        <h1 id="header1">A giant of jazz</h1>
        <p> One of the most admired, though sometimes controversial, pianists in jazz, Oscar Peterson (born 1925) in
            the post-war era claimed the same sort of status as earlier greats such as James P. Anderson, Art Tatum,
            Teddy Wilson, Fats Waller, Thelonious Monk, Bud Powell, and Bill Evans.<br><br>
            Possibly the most successful artist
            produced by Canada, he has appeared on well over 200 albums spanning six decades and has won numerous
            awards, including eight Grammys. During his career he has performed and recorded with, among others, Louis
            Armstrong, Count Basie, Ella Fitzgerald, Dizzy Gillespie, Duke Ellington, and Charlie Parker.</p><br>

            <h3 id="header2">Oscar Peterson's International Jazz Festival</h3>

        <p>The Oscar Peterson International Jazz Festival (OPIJF), one of Canada’s most anticipated winter music events,
            is named for the internationally renowned Canadian jazz giant. It was created to present the essence of jazz
            and the sound of swing. <br><br>
            <a href="https://www.opjazzfest.org/">
            <img src="images/OPFlogo.jpg" alt="Logo">
            </a>
            Oscar Peterson dedicated his life to music with intense vitality: music which
            encompasses the entire living history of jazz, and the OPIJF represents the same unshakable excellence and
            integrity for which he was known.<br><br>
            It is the mission of the OPIJF to showcase and celebrate world-class
            Canadian talent performing alongside American and international artists, thereby ensuring the future of jazz
            in Canada. Under the expert guidance of Artistic Director Renee Rosnes and Artistic Producer Kelly Peterson,
            this annual festival provides a unique opportunity to hear rare combinations of musicians and individual
            stars, in performance. Celebrate the past, the present, and the future — all at the same time.<br><br></p>
